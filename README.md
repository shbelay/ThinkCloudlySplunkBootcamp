# Splunk Bootcamp with ThinkCloudly

In April 2025, I joined the **Splunk Bootcamp** hosted by [ThinkCloudly](https://thinkcloudly.com/), a hands-on, instructor-led training designed for cybersecurity professionals. This was a five-day bootcamp that allowed me to experience Splunk, one of the most powerful and in-demand Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms used by organizations.

As someone actively pursuing a career transition into **Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis** and **threat hunting**, this bootcamp is a valuable opportunity to build foundational skills and get hands-on with tools and techniques used in real-world cyber defense.

Through live labs, real-world case studies, and expert-led instruction, I learned how to:
- Ingest and analyze machine-generated data
- Use **Search Processing Language (SPL)** to query logs
- Create dashboards and alerts
- Simulate cybersecurity incident investigations
- Understand Splunk architecture and data flow

With Splunk’s growing presence in the industry—used by over 90% of Fortune 100 companies, this bootcamp helped me gain confidence and clarity on my journey to becoming a SOC analyst.

This GitHub page documents my **daily progress**, **key takeaways**, and **hands-on exercises** from the bootcamp.
